        <h2 id="about">What Is Flip the Bottle?</h2>
        <p>Flip the Bottle is a fast, skill-based arcade game where your goal is simple but addictive: launch a partially filled bottle so it rotates in the air and lands upright. The challenge lies in timing, trajectory, and just the right spin. This browser version makes it easy to jump in and practice from anywhere—no downloads, no setup, just pure flipping fun.</p>
        <p>Unlike basic clickers, the bottle's physics matter. Too much force sends it sailing past the landing spot; too little and it barely turns. The most satisfying moments come when you chain several clean landings in a row, beat your previous record, and watch your confidence grow. Whether you have a minute between tasks or want a longer session to master a new technique, this game scales with your time and skill.</p>

        <h2 id="how">How to Play: Controls and Rules</h2>
        <p>On desktop, press and hold the mouse button (or spacebar in some setups) to charge your throw, then release to flip. On touch devices, tap and hold, then lift your finger. Your aim is to balance two variables: vertical power, which controls height and distance, and rotational momentum, which determines how many spins you complete before landing. You generally want a smooth, controlled arc with one full rotation for a stable upright landing.</p>
        <p>Most modes follow a simple rule: if the bottle lands upright, you score and continue; if it falls, your streak resets. Some levels add moving platforms, varying heights, or obstacles that demand precise timing. Start conservatively to learn the feel of your bottle, then push farther once you can reproduce the same motion consistently.</p>

        <h2 id="tips">Pro Tips to Boost Your High Score</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Build a repeatable motion.</strong> Pick a comfortable hold-and-release rhythm and stick with it. Consistency beats occasional "perfect" throws.</li>
          <li><strong>Watch your apex.</strong> Aim for a smooth arc where the bottle's highest point happens just before the landing platform. If the apex is too early, increase power slightly.</li>
          <li><strong>Use one full rotation.</strong> One clean spin usually gives the most control. Two or more rotations look flashy but dramatically increase risk on tight landings.</li>
          <li><strong>Mind platform edges.</strong> Hitting edges can bounce your bottle unpredictably. Target the center third of the platform whenever possible.</li>
          <li><strong>Adjust for device.</strong> Touchscreens may require a slightly longer press than mouse input. Take a minute to calibrate your feel after switching devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay patient after misses.</strong> A quick retry can spiral into multiple mistakes. Pause for one breath to reset your timing and recover your form.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice micro‑variations.</strong> Nudge power by 5–10% between attempts to discover the sweet spot for each level's distance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember: high scores reward rhythm and composure. Master the fundamentals first, then add risk only when you can control the outcome. That approach will steadily increase your longest streaks and total points.</p>

        <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p><strong>Is Flip the Bottle free?</strong> Yes—there's nothing to install and no purchase required to play in your browser.</p>
        <p><strong>Does it work on phones?</strong> It's designed to be mobile-friendly. Rotate to landscape for the best view and keep your screen brightness moderate to reduce eye strain.</p>
        <p><strong>Why did my bottle bounce off the platform?</strong> Too much horizontal speed or a late release often causes ricochets. Reduce power slightly and aim for a more vertical arc.</p>
        <p><strong>How do I save progress?</strong> Many browser games store basic progress locally. Keep your browser data intact and play from the same device to retain records.</p>
        <p><strong>Any accessibility tips?</strong> See the section below for control options and contrast settings to improve readability and comfort.</p>

        <h2 id="origin">The Bottle Flip Trend, From Real Life to Browser Game</h2>
        <p>The bottle flip craze exploded on social media when simple one-take videos showed people landing upright flips on desks, shelves, and impossible ledges. The appeal was obvious: it's easy to try, tricky to master, and incredibly satisfying to nail on camera. This digital version captures the same thrill without the mess. With reliable physics and bite-sized levels, you can experiment with different arcs and rotations in rapid succession, learning faster than you could with a real bottle.</p>

        <h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility and Performance</h2>
        <p>We designed this page with clean contrast and scalable text for readability. If animations are distracting, try reducing motion in your system settings—modern browsers respect that preference and may tone down transitions. On lower-end devices or slower connections, give the game a few extra seconds to load before your first attempt. For input comfort, a mouse offers precise control, while touchscreens provide a more natural press-and-release motion—use whichever feels best to you.</p>
