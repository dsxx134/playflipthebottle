        <h2 id="about">What Is Flip the Bottle?</h2>
        <p>Flip the bottle is an addictive skill-based game where you launch a water bottle to make it flip and land upright. This flip the bottle game challenges your timing and precision as you master the perfect arc and rotation. Our browser version lets you play instantly—no downloads needed, just pure flipping fun!</p>
        <p>The game physics are realistic: too much power sends your bottle flying, too little won't complete the rotation. Master the technique to chain perfect landings and beat your high score!</p>

        <h2 id="how">How to Play: Controls and Rules</h2>
        <p>On desktop, press and hold the mouse button (or spacebar in some setups) to charge your throw power. The longer you hold, the more force you'll apply. Release to launch the bottle with your chosen power level. On mobile devices, tap and hold anywhere on the screen, then lift your finger to flip.</p>
        <p>Most modes follow a simple rule: if the bottle lands upright, you score and continue to the next platform. If it falls over or misses entirely, your streak resets and you start over. The challenge increases as platforms become smaller, farther apart, or positioned at different heights.</p>
        <p>Master the timing between charge and release. Too quick results in weak flips that don't complete rotation. Too long creates excessive power that sends your bottle flying past the target. Find your sweet spot through practice and stick with consistent timing for better results.</p>

        <h2 id="tips">Pro Tips to Boost Your High Score</h2>
        <p>Unlike basic clickers, the bottle's physics matter. Too much force sends it sailing past the platform, while too little won't complete the rotation. Master these advanced techniques to consistently land perfect flips and dominate the leaderboards.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Master the Quarter-Full Sweet Spot</h3>
          <p>The secret to consistent bottle flip success lies in the water level. Fill your bottle to exactly 1/4 capacity for optimal center of gravity. This creates the perfect balance between rotational momentum and stability upon landing. Professional bottle flip players consistently use this ratio because it provides the most predictable physics behavior, making your flips more reliable than the common half-full approach.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Perfect Your Wrist Snap Technique</h3>
          <p>The key to mastering how to win bottle flip games is in your wrist motion, not arm strength. Use a quick, controlled wrist snap while keeping your arm relatively still. This technique generates clean rotation without excessive force that can cause over-spinning. Focus on a smooth upward flick that sends the bottle in a gentle arc rather than a high, dramatic flip.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Time Your Release at the Golden Angle</h3>
          <p>Release the bottle when your hand reaches approximately 45 degrees from vertical. This angle provides the optimal trajectory for a successful landing. Many players make the mistake of releasing too early or too late, but timing your release at this golden angle is one of the most effective bottle flip tips for achieving consistent results.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Control Landing Surface and Distance</h3>
          <p>Choose your landing surface wisely and maintain consistent distance. Hard, flat surfaces like tables work best, while soft or uneven surfaces absorb energy unpredictably. Stand approximately 2-3 feet from your target landing spot. This distance allows the bottle to complete one full rotation while giving you enough control over the landing zone.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Develop Your Rhythm and Mental Focus</h3>
          <p>Successful bottle flipping requires developing a consistent rhythm and maintaining mental focus. Take a moment to visualize the perfect flip before each attempt. Breathe steadily and avoid rushing between attempts. Many advanced players develop a pre-flip routine that helps them maintain consistency. Remember, learning how to win at bottle flip is as much about mental preparation as physical technique.</p>

        <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p><strong>Is Flip the Bottle free?</strong> Yes—there's nothing to install and no purchase required. Play directly in your browser with full access to all game features and levels.</p>
        <p><strong>Does it work on phones?</strong> It's designed to be mobile-friendly. Rotate to landscape mode for the best experience, as the wider screen gives you better control precision and visual clarity.</p>
        <p><strong>Why did my bottle bounce off the platform?</strong> Too much horizontal speed or a late release angle causes bounces. Focus on vertical trajectory with controlled power rather than maximum force.</p>
        <p><strong>How do I save progress?</strong> Many browser games store basic progress locally. Keep your browser data intact and use the same device to maintain your high scores and unlocked levels.</p>
        <p><strong>Any accessibility tips?</strong> See the section below for control options and contrast settings. The game supports keyboard controls on desktop and works with most assistive technologies.</p>

        <h2 id="origin">The Bottle Flip Trend, From Real Life to Browser Game</h2>
        <p>The bottle flip craze exploded on social media when simple one-take videos showed people successfully landing water bottles upright after flipping them. What started as a casual skill challenge became a viral phenomenon, inspiring countless variations and competitions worldwide.</p>
        <p>This browser version captures the satisfying physics and challenge of real bottle flipping while adding game elements like progressive difficulty, multiple platforms, and score tracking. You get the same rewarding feeling of nailing the perfect flip, but with unlimited bottles and no cleanup required.</p>

        <h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility and Performance</h2>
        <p>We designed this page with clean contrast and scalable text for readability. If you experience any accessibility issues, try adjusting your browser's zoom level or enabling high contrast mode. The game itself supports both mouse and keyboard controls for maximum compatibility.</p>
        <p>For optimal performance, ensure your browser supports modern web standards and consider closing other tabs if you experience lag. The game runs smoothly on most devices from the past five years.</p>

        <h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Build a repeatable motion.</strong> Pick a comfortable hold-and-release rhythm and stick with it throughout your session.</li>
          <li><strong>Watch your apex.</strong> Aim for a smooth arc where the bottle's highest point happens directly above the landing platform.</li>
          <li><strong>Use one full rotation.</strong> One clean spin usually gives the most control. Two or more rotations become unpredictable.</li>
          <li><strong>Mind platform edges.</strong> Hitting edges can bounce your bottle unpredictably. Target the center for consistent results.</li>
          <li><strong>Adjust for device.</strong> Touchscreens may require a slightly longer press than mouse clicks for the same power level.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay patient after misses.</strong> A quick retry can spiral into multiple mistakes. Pause briefly to reset your focus.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice micro‑variations.</strong> Nudge power by 5–10% between attempts to discover the sweet spot for each platform type.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Remember: high scores reward rhythm and composure. Master the fundamentals first, then gradually increase difficulty and distance challenges.</p>
