      "subtitle": "Find Your Base Power",
      "description": "Start simple. Do 5–10 warm‑up flips on a flat, wide platform and look for the lowest power that can complete a clean arc and land upright. Lock this in as your base power and make tiny changes from there. On desktop, keep your mouse press length consistent; on mobile, keep your finger position and press time consistent. Small, steady improvements beat random power spikes. This is the safest way to build reliable bottle flip tips that actually work in the game, not just on paper."
    },
    {
      "subtitle": "Go For One Clean Rotation",
      "description": "Most levels reward a single, smooth rotation. Aim for a simple up‑and‑down arc rather than a long horizontal throw. If you under‑rotate, add a touch of power or release a bit later; if you over‑rotate, cut a little power or release a bit earlier. Keep the bottle’s path straight and avoid side drift. Think: calm lift, clean spin, soft landing. This is the core how to flip a bottle skill that makes every other trick easier."
    },
    {
      "subtitle": "Stick The Landing (Center, Not Edge)",
      "description": "Land where the platform is most stable: the center. Edges are where bounces, tips, and slides happen. Let the bottle finish its rotation just above the surface so it ‘kisses’ the platform rather than slamming onto it. On bouncy or narrow surfaces, reduce power slightly and aim a bit toward the back third to counter forward momentum. These small adjustments turn near‑misses into perfect bottle flip moments."
    },
    {
      "subtitle": "Read The Level Before You Send It",
      "description": "Treat the first attempt like a scout. Watch what went wrong, then change one thing at a time: power, release timing, or target spot. Moving platforms? Throw a touch earlier so the platform meets your landing. Longer gaps? Add height but keep the spin calm. Obstacles above you? Lower the arc slightly and focus on a straight line. This practical, one‑change‑per‑try approach is the most reliable bottle flip game strategy."
    },
    {
      "subtitle": "Build A Simple Rhythm",
      "description": "Consistency beats intensity. Use a repeatable cadence—ready, flip, land—before each throw. Keep your setup the same: same hand position, same stance, same focus point on the platform. Train in short sets (for example: 10 flips, quick break, 10 flips) until your motion feels automatic. Track your best streak; try to beat it next session. That’s how bottle flip tricks turn into muscle memory."
    },
    {
      "subtitle": "Calm Under Pressure",
      "description": "Missed a few in a row? Reset fast. One deep breath, one practice motion, then one committed throw. Rushing creates more misses; slowing down a little brings back control. If a level feels ‘tilted’ against you, step back to an easier platform, land two clean flips, and come back. Confidence is a skill—build it on purpose."
    },
    {
      "subtitle": "Quick Fixes For Common Misses",
      "description": "Over‑rotation: slightly less power or a touch earlier release. Under‑rotation: a little more power or slightly later release. Sliding forward: aim closer to the platform center and reduce horizontal speed. Side drift: keep your arm path straight and your release vertical. Random bounces: soften the landing by trimming power and letting the bottle finish its spin just above the surface. These bottle flip tips solve 90% of everyday misses."
    },
    {
      "subtitle": "Device & Control Tweaks",
      "description": "Play in landscape on mobile for better control. On touch screens, anchor your thumb/finger at the same spot each time so press length stays consistent. On desktop, a mouse gives finer control than a trackpad. If the game feels jittery, clear other tabs and let the level load fully before your first flip. Small comfort tweaks = cleaner throws and better scores in this bottle flip game online."
